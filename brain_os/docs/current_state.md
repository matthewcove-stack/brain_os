# Brain OS — Current State (Authoritative)

## What works
- Intent ingestion and normalisation
- Shared schema contracts
- Notion Gateway API surface
- Manual local execution

## What is incomplete
- Action execution partially stubbed
- Context sync is manual
- No clarification UI
- No automated end-to-end tests

## Constraints
- Single user
- Notion is the system of record
- Reliability over cleverness
